# General-Django-CMS-Template

A Follower-Following Content Management System (Based on Twitter CMS).
This Project serves just as backend API. Host this as a server and connect it with your FrontEnd.

The Project DB is SQLITE-3, would recommend using a proper DB service such as PostGreSQL or MariaDB.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Django and Other Dependecies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
cd src
python manage.py runserver
```

## Alternative Installation (with Docker)

```bash
 docker build -t cms-api .
 docker run --name cms-api -d -p 8000:8000 cms-api:latest
```

> Create a super-user and then login to admin
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
